          <h2>About the Artist</h2>
          <p>
            Dad has been painting for over thirty years, finding inspiration in the
            landscapes, seascapes, and quiet corners of everyday life. Working
            primarily in oils and acrylics, each piece captures a moment of light
            and color that tells its own story.
          </p>
          <p>
            What started as a weekend hobby has grown into a lifelong passion.
            From sunrise sketches at the harbor to golden-hour landscapes in the
            countryside, every painting reflects a deep appreciation for the
            natural world and the simple beauty found in ordinary places.

            This gallery is a collection of that work — shared here for family,
            friends, and anyone who finds joy in art.
